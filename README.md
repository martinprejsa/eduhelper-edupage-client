# Eduhelper - Edupage Client in GTK
![License:MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)<br><br>
GTK desktop application written in Go with [gogtk3](https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3).
Provides user interface, that interacts with the [Edupage](https://www.edupage.org/) School system.<br>

Tested on `Arch Linux x86_64 6.0.2-arch1-1` with `KDE Plasma` desktop environment.

I'll probably continue expanding this project.
